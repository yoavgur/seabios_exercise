Seabios - Seabios is an open source implementation of a standard x86 BIOS. It can be used both on emulators (namely qemu and bachs), or on actual machines (from what I read, using coreboot).
This project is pretty handy for 2 reason:
	* Since BIOS doesn't have a clearly defined interface, this can provide a framework for how it should look and work - both for learning  and for use in general purpose open source projects.
	* Because of what I stated previously, BIOS's codes aren't really shared or published. This makes Seabios a really usefull open source implementation of it that can be used in projects like emulation.

I read from the README to just compile by running 'make', so I compiled it like that successfully. It then said to use 'out/bios.bin' when using Seabios with qemu, which looks to be a binary file (it's genereated by running checkrom.py on bios.bin.raw, which is generated by running '$(Q)$(OBJCOPY) -O binary rom.o $(OUT)bios.bin.raw').

I then ran the command 'qemu-system-x86_64 -bios out/bios.bin' to run a qemu virtual machine with my compiled bios. It did print in the beginning the BIOS was in fact Seabios, but I know that qemu uses Seabios by default ; so to make sure that it was in fact my bios, I changed a printf in the boot prints (printf("YOAV: Booting from ROM...\n");). I then booted again and saw my printf :).
